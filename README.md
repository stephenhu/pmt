# pmt - prompt hub cli tool

prompt hub is an llm prompt management system.  prompts are managed as packages with
versioning, dependencies, and can be re-used and composed for everyone.  prompt hub
is llm agnostic and works with all the well known llm's.

providing the right context to llm's makes a large difference in llm response accuracy.
